React.createElement => is a object => when we render is object into ReactDom then it become => HtmlElement

jsx is not html. jsx is just look like html or xml but it's not html or xml. jsx is a standalone and independant.

bable is use to tanpile jsx code into react. 

If you write jsx syntax in one line that is file but if you breakdown line into multiple lines then you have to wrap it into paranthesis()

e.g - 
single line - const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React ðŸš€ By Akshay Saini</h1>;

multiple line - const jsxHeading = ( <h1 id="heading">
Namaste React ðŸš€ By Akshay Saini
</h1> ) ; - paranthesis added

React Component ==>

Two ways to create Component => 1) class base component 2) functional Component

functional Component - it is nothing but javascript function.
how to create functional component ==> const HeadingComponent = () => { return <h1>Namaste React</h1>}

component composition mean use one compoent into another componet.

Swiggy - config-driven UI \

not using keys(not accetable) <<< index as a key <<<<<<<<< unique id (best practice)
use key = {} on loops

useEffect() method call on every render of that component
when dependancy array is not present then useEffect() method call on every render of that component
e.g useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("method call on every render of that component");
})

If dependancy array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render only (only once)
e.g useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect is called on initial render only (only once)");
}, [])

If dependancy array is [btnName] => useEffect is called on everytime btnName updated;
e.g useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect is called on initial render only (only once)");
}, [btnName])

useState() is use to create local state variable inside function. 
create it inside component. 
never create useState inside if..else/loops/functions conditions
